The open-source, text based story game about taking risks on the beach.

Welcome to Too Risky.

Too Risky is a story-based, educational computer game that runs in command line interfaces. It is about taking risks at the beach. This game was created for my PDHPE class at school.

This is the official GitHub page: github.com/airswidjaja/TooRisky.py Yeah! I'm still trying to figure out GitHub, so thanks for being patient.

As of 14 August 3:52 and 37 seconds this program has been discontinued.

Thanks.
